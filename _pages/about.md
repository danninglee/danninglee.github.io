Hi! I'm **Danning Li** (李丹宁), a recent graduate from [**McGill University**](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I majored in **Statistics** with a minor in **Computer Science**.

I am currently working as a **Research Assistant** at the [**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)**](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) in the **Thrust of Financial Technology**, supervised by [**Dr. Chao Zhang**](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/ZHANG-Chao/chaoz).

My research interests lie in the application of **artificial intelligence** and **statistical methods** to problems in **finance**, **healthcare**, and **business**. I am passionate about exploring how data-driven approaches can generate insights and support decision-making in real-world settings.
